# HiCAT: Hierarchical Centromere structure AnnoTation Tool

Advanced long-read sequencing technologies have revolutionized genome assembly, unlocking the complex region centromere and signaling the new stage in genomics research. The new computing problems generated by these new areas, like centromere annotation problem, required novel bioinformatics methods. Here, we proposed HiCAT, a generalized computational tool based on hierarchical tandem repeat mining (HTRM) method and a tandem repeat coverage maximization strategy to automatically process centromere annotation.
